# Alternatives 

## Jive

https://github.com/ImJimmi/JIVE

JIVE is a bundle of JUCE modules centered around the desire to have a more modern approach to UI development.

This approach is inspired by web front-ends where we write declarative markup (HTML) to define what components we have, style those components using style sheets (CSS), and then dynamically update those components at runtime using imperitive code (JavaScript).

It isn't a drag and drop GUI creator or editor, but you can script your components using an xml file. 

## Melatonin 

https://github.com/sudara/melatonin_inspector

A JUCE module that gives you the ability to inspect and visually edit (non-destructively) components in your UI.

It's inspired by Figma, web browser web inspectors and Jim Credland's Component Debugger juce-toys.
